### Things changed in *`patch-0.15`*
---
   
   
1. Added __my_strcmp__ function  
    ```C
    my_strcmp(char firstString[], char secondString[])
    ```   
    Compares two given strings, and returns 3 different values: 
      
    `1` - if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second one  
    `0` - if the two strings are lexicographically equal  
    `-1`   - if the first string is lexicographically less than the second one
